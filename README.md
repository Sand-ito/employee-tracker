Hi. Welcome to my attempt at the mysql homework. I thought I understood it better. Clearly I need to go back and redo the activites and reading. 

[here is a link to the demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VX4H9mNvfezeiBrLNTFSxrq3--Cz9W1W/view)

If you would like to operate the code. Open your terminal and enter `node index.js` and BOOM. You too can get your hands dirty with freshly made spaghetti and red sauce. 

I am taking this failure to populate a working app as a learn opportunity and will meet with my tutor and do much more reading on this subject as it is very clear I am unable to work with this language. Its about how hard you can get hit and still get back up and keep fighting, and I choose to keep fighting. This will only make me more determined to not suck :D.

Thanks for looking at the small appitizer of "spaghetti code" I have made for you. Have a great rest of your day.
